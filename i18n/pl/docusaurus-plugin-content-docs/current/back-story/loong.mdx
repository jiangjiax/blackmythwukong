## Loongs in Black Myth Wukong

Based on the game's promotional videos, we have learned about Kang Jin Loong and the two sons of Jing He Loong Wang, Chi Ran Loong and Xiao Li Loong.

## Loongs in Journey to the West

In "Journey to the West," the earliest appearance of loongs is the Four Seas Loong Kings, whom Sun Wukong visits to obtain a weapon and armor. After acquiring the Golden Cudgel, he further requests a set of good armor, which leads to the arrival of the other three seas' loong kings. Next is Jing He Loong Wang, who seeks help from Emperor Tang Taizong in a dream.

Subsequently, the narrative introduces the White Loong, known as the Third Prince of the Jade Loong, saved by Guanyin at Eagle's Gorge, and Tuo Loong, who captures Tang Sanzang, leading to the introduction of Jing He Loong Wang's nine sons.

In the novel, loongs often serve as deities overseeing rain and water bodies, with each river and well having its own loong king. Additionally, they are depicted as mounts for the Jade Emperor or as guardians and messengers for other deities.

## Real-world Loongs

Archaeological findings suggest that loong totems, including fish loongs, snake loongs, pig loongs, and crocodile loongs, emerged as early as 7,000 years ago due to primitive nature worship in China. The modern depiction of a loong is characterized by antlers like a deer, a head like a camel, eyes like a rabbit, a neck like a snake, a belly like a clam, scales like a fish, claws like an eagle, paws like a tiger, and ears like a cow. This distinctive image has been associated with roles such as messengers of the gods or divine mounts.

It is important to note that the powers of loongs to control wind and rain are closely linked to the sinicization of Buddhism. However, the worship of loongs as thunder deities is documented in texts from 6,000 years ago, including "The Classic of Mountains and Seas," "Records of the Five Emperors," and "Balanced Discourses."

In Buddhist scriptures, such as the "Lotus Sutra" translated in the Jin Dynasty, there are eight loong kings, including the Sea Loong King, Sa Jia Luo Loong Wang, who controls rainfall. However, it should be noted that the loongs in Buddhist texts often refer to nƒÅgas, serpentine beings that predate Buddhism in Indian mythology. These were incorporated into Buddhism and later translated into Chinese as loongs or snakes. Over time, as Buddhism was sinicized in China, the images of these deities in temples began to diverge from their Indian origins and assimilated into distinctly Chinese forms in popular culture.
