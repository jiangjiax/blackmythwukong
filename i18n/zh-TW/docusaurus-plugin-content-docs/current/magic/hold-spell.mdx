## Detailed Introduction

In the palm of the destined one, a golden character "å®š" is inscribed, granting them the extraordinary ability to manipulate the art of immobilization.

With a mere point of the finger and a whispered incantation, they can render their opponent motionless, unable to move.

However, formidable adversaries with great divine powers can break free from this restraint more swiftly, requiring caution.

If the battle is fierce and the opponent's attacks are relentless, it becomes difficult to keep them immobilized for long, yielding little advantage.

Perhaps the opportune moment to employ this technique is when the opponent is stationary, fallen, or pushed back into a weakened state.
