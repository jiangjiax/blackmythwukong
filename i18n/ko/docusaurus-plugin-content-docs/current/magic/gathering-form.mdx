## Detailed Introduction

The destined individual absorbs the essence of demons and monsters, naturally comprehending a movement technique.

After performing hand seals and incantations, one leaves behind a false form and quickly disperses into pure energy, moving swiftly and lightly, coming and going like smoke.

This technique can evade the opponent's sharp edge or lure them into a tight formation, allowing for strategic maneuvering.

Upon re-forming, one can launch a sudden kick or gather strength for a powerful strike. If the opponent is unprepared, it may catch them off guard.

Dispersing the Qi to escape has already recouped the cost; a successful counterattack brings additional gains.
