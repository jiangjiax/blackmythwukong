## Detailed Introduction

This spell is cast by the Chosen One using the hairs from their own body. By plucking a handful of hairs, chewing them to pieces in the mouth, and then spitting them into the air, numerous hair-monkeys are conjured into existence.

These hair-monkeys are nimble and agile, capable of fighting and fleeing, much like the Chosen One themselves. They will engage with the opponent when the master is threatened, providing an opportunity to catch one's breath or make a strategic retreat. However, the life of these hair-monkeys is fragile; facing a formidable and powerful adversary, they risk being swiftly annihilated.
