# Ruyi Jingu Bang

Ruyi Jingu Bang is the weapon used by Sun Wukong in the Ming Dynasty novel "Journey to the West," a classic Chinese fantasy tale about gods and demons.

## Introduction

The official name of Sun Wukong's weapon in the novel is "Ruyi Jingu Bang," with other aliases including Jingu Ruyi Bang, Jingu Tie Bang, Ruyi Bang, Jingu Bang, Lingyang Bang, and Tie Bang, the latter being the most frequently used abbreviation. According to "Journey to the West," the Ruyi Jingu Bang is described as "two ends capped with golden bands, a middle section of dark iron; close to the bands are inscribed the words 'Ruyi Jingu Bang,' weighing 13,500 catties." The Dragon Lady and Dragon Maiden of the East Sea Dragon Palace refer to it as the "Divine Treasure Iron." Wang Bo's "Stele Inscription for the Pagoda of Guangzhou Bao Zhuang Temple" mentions: "The sincere heart is mysteriously moved, and the divine treasure is revealed." After Sun Wukong obtains the Divine Treasure, it becomes responsive to his thoughts, capable of changing in size and length according to his will, truly living up to the name "Ruyi" (as one wishes).

## Origins

The "Golden Ring Cane Theory." In "The Poetic Tale of the Great Tang's Pilgrimage for Scriptures," the Monkey Pilgrim does not have a weapon but relies on the golden ring cane bestowed by the Great Brahma Heaven King to capture monsters and demons.

The "Mixed Theory of Diamond Cane and Golden Ring Cane." Japanese scholars believe that the image of the Vajra Cane from Esoteric Buddhism influenced the image of Sun Wukong in "Journey to the West," leading to the creation of the Jingu Bang.

The "Gold Club and Iron Club Theory." In the Yuan Dynasty drama "Journey to the West," Sun Wukong uses a gold club that can change its form; in "Journey to the West Pinghua," Sun Wukong uses an iron club, which had a direct impact on "Journey to the West."

The "Jinggu Bang Theory." Mr. Zhou Ruchang believes that "Jingu Bang" is actually "Jinggu Bang," a term that was misinterpreted due to its pronunciation and became associated with "Jingu" (golden band).

The "Ruyi Pearl Theory." "Ruyi Pearl" is a type of Buddhist treasure, also known as "Mani Pearl." It is said that possessing this pearl allows one to see all things in the world, to transform objects at will, and to dispel all calamities and afflictions. "The Great Wisdom Sutra" states that this pearl is born from the brain of a dragon king. "The Great Convenience Sutra of Buddha's Benevolence" says that the dragon king keeps the Ruyi Pearl in his left ear.
