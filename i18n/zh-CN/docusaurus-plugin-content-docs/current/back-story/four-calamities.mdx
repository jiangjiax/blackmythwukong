# The Four Calamities

The Four Calamities refer to the four major disasters in the universe: thunderstrike, fire, freezing cold, and poisoning. Whenever these calamities accumulate to a certain extent, they inflict corresponding damage. One can consume medicinal herbs to alleviate the affected state.

## Historical Background

The concept of the Four Calamities is likely adapted from the original Three Calamities, which are mentioned in Chapter Two of the Chinese novel "Journey to the West." The Three Calamities are a reference to the three disasters that a practitioner of Taoism must face during their cultivation: thunderstrike, fire, and wind. These calamities are not merely physical challenges but also spiritual trials that test the practitioner's resolve and purity. The addition of the fourth calamity, poisoning, in this context may be an adaptation to expand the range of challenges and dangers faced by the characters in the story.
