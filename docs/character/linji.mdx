## Background Story of Lingji Bodhisattva

Lingji Bodhisattva is a relatively minor character in Journey to the West, but in Black Myth: Wukong, he is given a more profound symbolic significance. In the game, Lingji Bodhisattva manifests as the Headless Monk, representing loss and the pain of deprivation. According to the story, he suffered misfortune on Huangfeng Mountain, where his head was stolen by a rat demon, which then used it as a vessel for its own cultivation. This narrative not only reflects the Bodhisattva's plight but also serves as a metaphor for broader cultural and historical themes.

## The Theft of the Head and the British Museum

In reality, the head of Lingji Bodhisattva was stolen approximately a century ago and brought to England, where it eventually ended up in the British Museum. This incident is linked to the history of the Xiang Hall Mountain Caves, which suffered extensive looting and destruction, resulting in the theft of many Buddha statues' heads, including that of Lingji Bodhisattva.

This phenomenon has led to widespread discussions about the protection of cultural heritage. Many people express dissatisfaction with the British Museum's collection of non-native artifacts, arguing that these items should be returned to their countries of origin. The head of Lingji Bodhisattva is not just a historical relic; it symbolizes cultural identity and serves as a reminder of the suffering endured by the people of that land.
