## Zhu Bajie's Character Introduction

### Appearance and Personality

Unlike the chubby image seen in previous films and TV series, the in-game Zhu Bajie has a short stature and a furry appearance that is quite adorable. His personality is complex; although he appears charming on the surface, he is not entirely benevolent. He frequently complains to the player and refers to himself as "Uncle Zhu" and the player as "Nephew".

### Interaction Mechanics

Zhu Bajie is not only an NPC in the game but can also assist the player in fending off enemies using his rake. However, if the player offends him, he will retaliate with violence. For example, if the player continuously bumps into Zhu Bajie, he will angrily shout "Unruly monkey!" and swing his rake in attack. This interaction mechanism adds a sense of humor and challenge to the game.

## Background Introduction

Zhu Bajie is an important character in the classic Chinese novel Journey to the West, originally named "Zhu Bajie". In the original work, he is portrayed as a greedy, lustful but loyal character with a humorous side.

In Black Myth: Wukong, Zhu Bajie also participates in Sun Wukong's journey to the West. However, unlike the original, his portrayal is more lively and his personality more complex.

## Cultural Background

The image of Zhu Bajie in Black Myth: Wukong resonates with the characteristics of native Chinese pig breeds. Most native breeds are black, while the traditional white pig image is more common among imported breeds. This design choice not only gives the character a local flavor but also reflects the game development team's attention to cultural details.
