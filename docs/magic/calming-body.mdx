## Detailed Introduction

The destined individual, by chance, learned this life-preserving extraordinary art in a bitterly cold and icy region.

By simply taking a staff and drawing a circle on the ground, one can ward off the cold and rest, preparing for defense against enemies.

Standing within the circle allows for a continuous increase in staff momentum and accelerates the recovery of energy; if warm wine is consumed during this time, it yields even greater effects.

The fiery circle has a relatively long duration, and even if one steps out of the formation to engage in combat for a short while, they can return to the circle at any time to seek another opportunity.

Once the time limit is reached, the formation naturally dissipates.
