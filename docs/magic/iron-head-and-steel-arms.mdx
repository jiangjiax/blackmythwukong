## Detailed Introduction

The destined individual encounters extraordinary perils and adventures, mastering a defensive technique through profound comprehension.

By shrugging the shoulders and straightening the back, one transforms into a block of gold and stone. If an opponent happens to strike this hardened form, it can jar their grip, causing pain.

If the opponent is repelled by the shock, caught off guard, it presents an excellent opportunity for a follow-up attack.

This technique appears clumsy, yet it requires precise timing to be effective. Using it too early or too late may render it useless.

Some opponents are robust and valiant, and their powerful strikes can even break through the Rock Solid.
