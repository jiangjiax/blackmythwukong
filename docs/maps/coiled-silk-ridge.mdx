# Coiled Silk Ridge Map in Black Myth: Wukong

## Coiled Silk Ridge in Journey to the West

In the original text of Journey to the West, Coiled Silk Ridge is first mentioned in Chapter 72, titled "Silk Cave: Seven Emotions Confuse the Original Nature; Washing the Dirt Spring: Zhu Bajie Loses Control."

The local land deity introduces Sun Wukong to the area, mentioning that there is a cave called Silk Cave beneath Coiled Silk Ridge, which is inhabited by seven female demons. To the south of Silk Cave, there is a spring known as Washing the Dirt Spring, which is a naturally occurring hot spring that was originally the bathing pool of the Seven Fairies but has since been occupied by the demons.
