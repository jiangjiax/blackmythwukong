# Lingxuzi In Black Myth: Wukong

Lingxuzi is a Yaoguai King boss located in the Guanyin Temple of Black Wind Mountain. He is a massive gray wolf spirit and a companion of the Black Wind King.

The character's design and abilities draw inspiration from traditional Chinese mythology, where Lingxuzi is associated with the wolf spirit "Lingxuzi," known for his formidable presence and connection to the Black Wind King.

## Strategy

Lingxuzi's attacks are powerful yet straightforward, with a maximum of four-hit combos (based on the 2020 gameplay demonstration). His attacks have long startup and recovery times, allowing players ample time to react. He is extremely weak to fire attributes, making the Knife Wolf instructor "Guangzhi" an excellent transformation choice, as each attack can interrupt and damage the boss.

As a gray wolf spirit, Lingxuzi has thick fur that makes him vulnerable to fire.

## Moves

### Tearing Claw

This is an opening move where Lingxuzi runs forward two steps and then jumps, quickly spreading his arms to attack.
