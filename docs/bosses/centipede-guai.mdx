# Centipede Guai In Black Myth: Wukong

In Black Myth: Wukong, Centipede Guai is the boss of the Qianhong Cavern region in the trial event and serves as an "instructional boss."

## Strategy

The swarm of insects summoned by the Centipede Guai moves slowly. By running swiftly around the cave, you can potentially leave them behind.

When it strikes, I dodge; when it rolls, I pursue; when it roars, I run. Find an opportunity? Punish it with a combo and that's it!

## Moves

### Fixed Opening

#### Leap

At the start, the Centipede Guai will leap from a distance. You can dodge a bit slower to avoid it. If the player controls the character to move forward and roll, they will end up behind the Centipede Guai; a side roll will usually end up to the side or in front of the Centipede Guai.

After dodging the leap, you can counterattack with a light attack, but there usually isn't enough time to complete a full light attack combo. The Centipede Guai will then initiate subsequent attacks based on the player's position.

(Note that the leap is not an exclusive opening move; during normal engagement, when the player is far from the Centipede Guai, it may also lead to a leap.)

#### Triple Smash

When the player dodges the leap and stays in front of the Centipede Guai's head, it will initiate two head smashes followed by one back smash, which is slower than the head smashes.

#### Back Smash

When the player dodges the leap and stays behind the Centipede Guai, it will directly initiate a back smash.

The handling method is the same as the back smash after the two head smashes.

### Normal Engagement

#### Long-range Poison Spray

At a greater distance, the Centipede Guai sprays toxic liquid forward. The player can slightly maneuver to avoid most of the damage.

#### Phase 1 Bug Roll

At a distance, the Centipede Guai curls up and rolls quickly towards the player 3-5 times.

The player can choose to use "Iron Will" to stop the roll at the starting phase. If the roll has already gained enough acceleration, it will not be stopped by "Iron Will" but will continue to roll after collision.

If the Centipede Guai has already accelerated, the third roll is a point of concern for the player. In the first phase (before summoning the swarm), the roll is fixed at three segments. If the third segment misses the player, it will stop after hitting the wall, giving the player some time to attack; if the third segment hits the player, the Centipede Guai will drift and stop in the arena, immediately following up with the next move, leaving the player with no time to attack.

#### Mid-range Charge

At a medium distance (about the length of a roll), the Centipede Guai arches its body and charges forward twice, with the second charge having strong directional correction and stopping only when it hits the wall.

If you have two or more "beans," you can consider quickly erecting a staff to avoid the charge attack and then counterattack with a three-bean charge.

#### Close-range Poison Spray

At a closer distance, the Centipede Guai sprays toxic liquid downwards. The player can maneuver to avoid the damage.

### Phase 2

#### On-the-spot Casting

The Centipede Guai lets out a long howl, summoning dozens of small insects that curl up into spherical shapes and roll towards the player. The player can use the staff charging method or staff spinning to block.
