# Tiger Vanguard in Black Myth: Wukong

Centuries ago, the previous Tiger Vanguard lost his life while trying to capture Xuanzang. His two sons, left behind, had to fend for themselves. The elder brother, Tiger Brother, led the remaining small demons through the devastated mountain, struggling to survive. Fortunately, their father had taught them some real skills, allowing them to persevere.

As the sandstorms subsided, Mother Stone and the Stone Sprites rebuilt the mountain to its former glory. Tiger Brother, following his father's example, managed the group of monsters in the mountain, ensuring they each had a role and did not randomly harm living beings. Later, some mortals built a village in the mountain, and Tiger Brother, adhering to the custom of "devouring evil trespassers and guiding good travelers," earned himself the title of "Tiger God."

The villagers built the Crouching Tiger Temple to worship the "Tiger God," which made Tiger Brother's younger brother, Tiger Brother, increasingly dissatisfied, feeling that his elder brother was hogging all the prestige, simply because he was born a few years earlier.

After another hundred years, the Great Sage Monkey suddenly returned to Yellow Wind Ridge with a group of rat demons. Tiger Brother was displeased, saying it was precisely because of this yellow-haired rat spirit that their father had lost his life. He instigated Tiger Brother to drive away the rat demons, and Tiger Brother, finding it reasonable, agreed.

However, in the battle, the Great Sage Monkey brandished a weapon resembling a Buddha's head, summoning blades from the wind, severely injuring Tiger Brother with a single strike. To save his brother's life, Tiger Brother had no choice but to throw down his weapon and kneel in submission. The Great Sage Monkey, not holding a grudge, learned of the brothers' history and appointed Tiger Brother as a vanguard under his command.

Tiger Brother recovered, but upon learning that his brother had become a vanguard, he refused to obey. The two tigers had a big argument, and Tiger Brother stormed off in a fit of anger, refusing to have anything to do with his brother again.

For the Tiger Vanguard, that yellow-haired weasel-rat had caused him to lose his family twice, which was truly hateful. But aside from eating more rats to vent his anger every day, what else could he do?

## Moves

### Charging Slam

The Tiger Vanguard starts by shoulder-charging a distance before leaping up and slamming the ground. This move is relatively easy to perfectly dodge, and after the slam, there is an exposed joint animation.

### Three-Hit Downward Hook Punch into Slam

The Tiger Vanguard assumes a stance, lightly pulling his right arm back, then leans forward and unleashes a spinning kick to close the distance, immediately following with two consecutive forward punches (right, then left). After a brief charge-up, he leaps into the air and slams down.

The Tiger Vanguard's spinning kick has considerable movement, allowing him to quickly pressure the player. Watch out for the timing and direction of the dodge. After perfectly evading the two punch combos, wait for the slam's recovery window to punish him.
