# Elder Jinchi In Black Myth: Wukong

Elder Jinchi is the abbot of the Avalokitesvara Monastery. When Xuanzang's party passed by, he became greedy upon seeing Xuanzang's brocade cassock. Ultimately, he died when the monastery was burned down, transforming into a Yaoguai king boss. His identity and experiences reflect the themes of greed and sin, suggesting that his wrong choices in life led to his current status as a Yaoguai king boss.

## Strategy

Elder Jinchi's fighting style is characterized by high damage and area-of-effect attacks. During the battle, players can regain health by defeating the acolytes in the arena, which reduces the difficulty. Overall, Elder Jinchi's battle mechanics are similar to those of the Wraith, but due to his high damage output and ability to summon minions, players need to pay more attention to their battle strategy.

## Moves
