# Red-bottomed Macaque In Black Myth: Wukong

In Black Myth: Wukong, the Red-bottomed Macaque is a boss in the region of Little Thunder Monastery in the game "Black Myth: Wu Kong."

In "Journey to the West," the Red-bottomed Macaque is not specifically referring to a single monkey but rather a species. Among the four old monkeys of the Flower Fruit Mountain, two are Red-bottomed Macaques, and one of the Four Great Monkeys of Chaos is also a Red-bottomed Macaque. The original text describes it as "knowing yin and yang, adept in human affairs, skilled in coming and going, and capable of avoiding death and prolonging life."

## Strategy

## Moves
