# Blade Wolf Instructor In Black Myth: Wukong

Blade Wolf Instructor appears in the game "Black Myth: Wukong" as the leader of Black Wind Mountain, whose real name is "Guang Zhi."

Guang Zhi appears in the sixteenth chapter of the original "Journey to the West," titled "Monk of Guanyin Monastery Plots Treasures, Monster of Black Wind Mountain Steals Cassock." He is the disciple of Jinchi Elder at Guanyin Monastery. When Monk Tang and his disciple, Sun Wukong, arrive at the monastery, the Jinchi Elder welcomes them warmly. Wukong shows off his cassock to the elder, who becomes covetous and borrows it to admire it in his room. The elder, wanting to possess the cassock, takes Guang Zhi's suggestion to kill Monk Tang with a knife, but fails. Then, he listens to his other disciple, Guang Mou's advice, and orders the monks to set fire, intending to burn Monk Tang and his disciple to death. Wukong goes to the Southern Heaven Gate to borrow a fire-retardant cover from the Heavenly King Guangmu to protect his master, and then blows a divine wind that burns the Guanyin Monastery into a pile of rubble. Ashamed and terrified, the elder has no face to see anyone and dies by smashing his head against the wall.

## Strategy

Overpower it to prevent it from using its skills.

## Moves

### Dash and Double Slash

The Blade Wolf Instructor stands still, gathering strength to swing his double-edged blade for a moment, then dashes forward to the player's vicinity and swings, followed by two consecutive downward attacks, each accompanied by a short tracking movement. The first dash of this move has a long pre-movement phase, making it easy to dodge, but the second attack has a suspicion of fast and slow blades, so caution is needed when dodging and counterattacking. The second rotation of the three attacks involves spinning the blade in hand, creating a full 360-degree attack judgment around the body.
